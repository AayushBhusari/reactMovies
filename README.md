- **Search for Movies**: Easily search for movies by name using real-time suggestions from the TMDb API.
- **Movie Details**: Get detailed information about each movie, including title, poster, release date, overview, genres, and average ratings.
- **Smooth Search Experience**: Real-time search suggestions are displayed as you type, making it easier to find your favorite movies.

## Future Improvements

- **Movie Trailer**: Display trailers for movies when a user clicks on a movie.
- **User Reviews**: Add a feature to allow users to write and view reviews for each movie.
- **Watchlist**: Allow users to add movies to their personal watchlist.
- **Dark Mode**: Provide a dark mode option for a better user experience.
